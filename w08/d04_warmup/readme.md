## JavaScript

Given an array of unsorted positive ints, write a function that finds runs of 3 consecutive numbers (ascending or descending) and returns the indices where such runs begin.  If no such runs are found, return null.

`function findConsecutiveRuns(input:Array):Array`

Example:  [1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 9, 8, 9, 10, 11, 7] would return [0, 4, 6, 7]
