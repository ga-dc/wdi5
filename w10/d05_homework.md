## OPTIONAL: Advance Reading

Homework on Monday night will include a reading component in preparation for Tuesday's lessons. If you want to start that early, here's what it'll be:

### Front-End Track

Read through [Backbone Tutorials](http://backbonetutorials.com).

We suggest the beginner tutorials on:
* [http://backbonetutorials.com/why-would-you-use-backbone/](Why Backbone?)
* [http://backbonetutorials.com/what-is-a-model/](What is a Model?)
* [http://backbonetutorials.com/what-is-a-collection/](What is a Collection?)

The video on the front page is pretty good as well.

### Back-End Track

Read through this tutorial on Express:
