# The Book List

    var books = [
      {
	title: 'The Design of EveryDay Things',
	author: 'Don Norman',
	alreadyRead: false
      },
      { 
	title: 'The Most Human Human',
	author: 'Brian Christian',
	alreadyRead: true
      }
    ];

- Create a webpage with an h1 of "My Book List".
- Add a script tag to the bottom of the page, where all your JS will go.
- Copy the array of books from above.
- Iterate through the array of books. For each book, create a p element with the book title and author and append it to the page.

## Bonus

- Use a ul and li to display the books.
- Add a property to each book with the URL of the book cover, and add an img element for each book on the page.
- Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it or not.
